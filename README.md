# Conv-EncDec-PyTorch
Convolutional Encoder Decoder network based on the SegNet architecture for unsupervised feature learning
[WIP]
[Detailed Readme to be added]

This SegNet based Convolutional Encoder-Decoder network can be used for unsupervised feature learning for particular datasets.
The PyTorch Dataset class for the MICCAI dataset has been provided. You can make the changes in that to adapt to your dataset.

A sample training script is also provided.
